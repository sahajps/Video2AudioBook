He had a habit of wasting time and procrastinating on important tasks. Despite the constant advice from his family and friends to value time, Rohan didn't seem to understand its importance. One sunny day, a wise old man named Mr. Gupta arrived in the village. He was known for his wisdom and ability to solve people's problems. Word quickly spread, and soon Rohan heard about the arrival of Mr. Gupta. Curiosity peaked, he decided to seek the old man's guidance. Rohan approached Mr. Gupta, who was sitting under a large banyan tree. With a respectful bow, he asked, Sir, I've been told that you possess great wisdom. Can you please guide me on how to make the most of my life? Mr. Gupta smiled and nodded, understanding the young man's struggle. He took out an hourglass from his bag and handed it to Rohan. This hourglass symbolizes time, he said. Each grain of sand represents a precious moment of your life. Rohan held the hourglass in his hands, feeling the weight of its significance. Now, Mr. Gupta continued, I want you to imagine that each grain of sand falling through this hourglass is a wasted opportunity. Every time you procrastinate or waste time, a grain slips away forever. Rohan, realizing the gravity of his actions, listened intently as Mr. Gupta continued. Time is a precious gift, my boy. It waits for no one. Every second that passes is a second you cannot retrieve. If you keep squandering it, you will wake up one day filled with regret. Feeling a sense of urgency, Rohan asked, But how can I change? How can I value time and make the most of it? Mr. Gupta smiled warmly. It begins with small steps, he said. Start by setting goals and prioritize your tasks. Break them down into manageable parts and focus on completing them one by one. Learn to manage your time effectively. Remember, success comes to those who understand the value of time. Rohan took the old man's advice to heart and decided to change his ways. He began by organizing his daily routine, setting specific time frames for different activities. He eliminated distractions and focused solely on the task at hand. Gradually, Rohan noticed a positive shift in his life. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. Rohan's newfound dedication and discipline paid off. He accomplished tasks that he had been putting off for years. He pursued his passions and discovered hidden talents. The villagers marveled at the remarkable transformation they witnessed in Rohan. Over time, Rohan realized that the true power of time lay not just in accomplishing tasks, but in nurturing relationships. He spent quality time with his family and friends, appreciating the moments they shared.

He shared his journey with the younger generation, urging them to cherish every passing moment and make the most of their lives.

    "Videos/cooking.mp4": " I'm gonna show you how to make soft velvety scrambled eggs aka perfect. So I'm gonna start by cracking our eggs into a bowl and I'm gonna use three eggs for each. I like cracking my egg on a flat surface so that the shells don't crack into a bowl and with my whisk I'm just gonna mix mix mix. I love eating eggs any time of day. They're full of protein, they keep me full and they pretty much go with everything. So if you noticed I didn't add any water or any milk to the eggs to make it creamy. But what you're looking for is a cohesive mix between the egg whites and the egg yolks. And this looks good. The consistency of your scrambled eggs is really a preference-based thing. I tend to like mine a little bit on the soft and runny side, whereas Eresene and Nate kind of likes it on the super cooked and like a Tamago type. Very firm and almost dry. So in a pan on medium to low heat, I want to keep the temperature very consistent, not too high. I'm going to add half a tablespoon of butter. I'll let it get nice and melted. Now we'll add in our three whisked eggs. And with my spatula, I like using the silicone based ones so that they don't scrape the bottom of my pan. And the name of the game here is to go low and slow. As it starts to cook, I'm just going to take my spatula and gently scrape the bottom of the pan and let the eggs kind of curdle up and form ribbons. Once it looks like the eggs are about 3 quarters of the way cooked, I like to turn off my heat. And let it finish up in the pan like this. And now we add our unique seasonings. Here I'm gonna add a pinch of salt, a little bit of black pepper, and whatever other toppings you like. Mm-mm-mm."

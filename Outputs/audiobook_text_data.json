He had a notorious habit of wasting time, procrastinating on tasks that were deemed important by others. Despite the constant advice from his family and friends to value time, Rohan seemed oblivious to its true importance.\n\nOne sunny day, the village buzzed with excitement as a wise old man named Mr. Gupta arrived. He was renowned for his wisdom and his remarkable ability to solve people's problems. News of his arrival spread quickly, reaching even the ears of the curious Rohan. Intrigued, Rohan decided to seek the old man's guidance.\n\nRohan approached Mr. Gupta, who was sitting under a large, ancient banyan tree, its branches swaying gently in the breeze. With a respectful bow, Rohan asked,\n\n(young male: Sir, I've been told that you possess great wisdom. Can you please guide me on how to make the most of my life?)\n\nMr. Gupta smiled, a warm, knowing smile that seemed to understand the young man's struggle. He reached into his bag and handed Rohan an hourglass.\n\n(elderly male: This hourglass symbolizes time. Each grain of sand represents a precious moment of your life.)\n\nRohan held the hourglass in his hands, feeling the weight of its significance. The grains of sand slipped through his fingers, each one a moment that could never be reclaimed.\n\n(elderly male: Now, I want you to imagine that each grain of sand falling through this hourglass is a wasted opportunity. Every time you procrastinate or waste time, a grain slips away forever.)\n\nRealizing the gravity of his actions, Rohan listened intently as Mr. Gupta continued.\n\n(elderly male: Time is a precious gift, my boy. It waits for no one. Every second that passes is a second you cannot retrieve. If you keep squandering it, you will wake up one day filled with regret.)\n\nFeeling a sense of urgency, Rohan asked,\n\n(young male: But how can I change? How can I value time and make the most of it?)\n\nMr. Gupta smiled warmly, his eyes twinkling with encouragement.\n\n(elderly male: It begins with small steps. Start by setting goals and prioritize your tasks. Break them down into manageable parts and focus on completing them one by one. Learn to manage your time effectively. Remember, success comes to those who understand the value of time.)\n\nTaking the old man's advice to heart, Rohan decided to change his ways. He began by organizing his daily routine, setting specific time frames for different activities. He eliminated distractions and focused solely on the task at hand. Gradually, Rohan noticed a positive shift in his life.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks into months. Rohan's newfound dedication and discipline paid off. He accomplished tasks that he had been putting off for years. He pursued his passions and discovered hidden talents. The villagers marveled at the remarkable transformation they witnessed in Rohan.\n\nOver time, Rohan realized that the true power of time lay not just in accomplishing tasks, but in nurturing relationships. He spent quality time with his family and friends, appreciating the moments they shared. He understood that time was a limited resource, and every second spent in the company of loved ones was a treasure.\n\nYears passed, and Rohan grew old. His village honored him for his remarkable achievements and his wise use of time. He shared his journey with the younger generation, urging them to cherish every passing moment and make the most of their lives. Rohan's story spread far and wide, inspiring countless individuals to re-evaluate their relationship with time. People began to understand that time was not just a mere commodity, but a precious gift that needed to be treasured.\n\nAnd so, the village thrived under the wisdom of Mr. Gupta and the transformed life of Rohan, reminding everyone of the importance of time and the power it held to shape their destinies.",

The woman, donned in a floral shirt, stands at the counter, her focus unwavering as she prepares a culinary delight. The well-lit kitchen around her is a serene backdrop, with a wooden cabinet and a gleaming oven standing sentinel. A charming white tea set rests on a tray, adding a touch of elegance to the scene.\n\n(female adult: I'm gonna show you how to make soft velvety scrambled eggs, aka perfect.)\n\nThe woman begins her task with an air of confidence and grace. She carefully cracks three eggs into a bowl, her movements precise and deliberate.\n\n(female adult: I like cracking my egg on a flat surface so that the shells don't crack into a bowl.)\n\nWith practiced ease, she picks up a whisk, the rhythmic sound of mixing filling the room.\n\n(female adult: And with my whisk, I'm just gonna mix mix mix.)\n\nHer passion for cooking is evident as she speaks with warmth and enthusiasm.\n\n(female adult: I love eating eggs any time of day. They're full of protein, they keep me full, and they pretty much go with everything.)\n\nThe mixture in the bowl swirls into a harmonious blend, the egg whites and yolks merging seamlessly.\n\n(female adult: So if you noticed I didn't add any water or any milk to the eggs to make it creamy. But what you're looking for is a cohesive mix between the egg whites and the egg yolks. And this looks good.)\n\nShe shares her preferences with a touch of humor.\n\n(female adult: The consistency of your scrambled eggs is really a preference-based thing. I tend to like mine a little bit on the soft and runny side, whereas Eresene and Nate kind of likes it on the super cooked and like a Tamago type. Very firm and almost dry.)\n\nThe woman turns her attention to the stove, setting a pan over medium to low heat.\n\n(female adult: So in a pan on medium to low heat, I want to keep the temperature very consistent, not too high.)\n\nHer hands move deftly as she measures out a slice of butter, placing it in the pan with care.\n\n(female adult: I'm going to add half a tablespoon of butter. I'll let it get nice and melted.)\n\nThe butter sizzles softly, releasing a rich aroma as it melts. She pours the whisked eggs into the pan, their golden hue bright against the white surface.\n\n(female adult: Now we'll add in our three whisked eggs.)\n\nWith a silicone spatula in hand, she begins to gently stir, her movements slow and deliberate.\n\n(female adult: And with my spatula, I like using the silicone based ones so that they don't scrape the bottom of my pan. And the name of the game here is to go low and slow.)\n\nThe eggs start to cook, forming delicate ribbons as they curdle and thicken.\n\n(female adult: As it starts to cook, I'm just going to take my spatula and gently scrape the bottom of the pan and let the eggs kind of curdle up and form ribbons.)\n\nShe watches intently, knowing just when to turn off the heat.\n\n(female adult: Once it looks like the eggs are about 3 quarters of the way cooked, I like to turn off my heat. And let it finish up in the pan like this.)\n\nThe final touch is a sprinkle of seasonings, her personal flair evident in every choice.\n\n(female adult: And now we add our unique seasonings. Here I'm gonna add a pinch of salt, a little bit of black pepper, and whatever other toppings you like. Mm-mm-mm.)\n\nThe atmosphere is calm and focused, the woman's smile a testament to her joy in sharing this simple yet satisfying dish."

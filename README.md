## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project  

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.11.11
- Required libraries (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
- OpenAI API key to `audiobook_text.py`

### Step-by-Step Execution  
1. **Download Videos**  
   - Save videos as `.mp4` files in the `Videos/` directory.  
   - Video links are provided in `video_links.json`.  

2. **Run Scripts in Order**  
   Execute the following scripts sequentially:  
   ```bash
   python3 video_desc_gen.py         # Extracts video descriptions  
   python3 video_sound_text.py       # Converts audio to text  
   python3 audiobook_text.py         # Processes text for audiobook formatting  
   python3 audiobook_audio.py        # Generates the final audiobook  

### Outputs
- **JSON Files**: Generated by the first three scripts (metadata, transcribed text, formatted text).

- **Audiobook**: Saved as `.wav` in `Outputs/Audiobooks/` with the same name as the input video.
